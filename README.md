This small game was created as a final project for ICS 3UI, in which students had to build a single file graphical hangman clone from scratch using only John Zelle's graphics library.

The game features the base requirements of:
* File I/O is used to store over 3 puzzle categories which contain at least 100 separate strings for each category. These files incorporate puzzles with more than one word in them.

* Puzzle words that are selected from the file list at random.

* Puzzle words that are processed as strings or lists.

* The user recieves constant feedback as to their progress in the puzzle, what letters have been selected, display the puzzle with the correctly guessed letters in place, and how many wrong guesses they have made.

* Graphic feedback to display the players progress.

* A full GUI which does not require the use of the keyboard.

* A robust user interface that can handle common errors gracefully.

* The program ends only when the user wishes to exit by selecting quit.
