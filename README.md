# Racing Hangman

This small game was created as a final project for ICS 3UI, in which students had to build a single file graphical hangman clone from scratch using only John Zelle's graphics library. Must be run with PyScripter to work without error.

The game features:
* File I/O used to store over 3 puzzle categories which contain at least 100 separate words for each category.
* Puzzle words that are selected from the file list at random.

* A full GUI which does not require the use of the keyboard.
* A 3 track soundtrack from Space Station 13.
* A robust user interface that can handle common errors gracefully.
* A High Score menu
